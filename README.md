# DBT-RISE
A versatile Dynamic Binary Translation (DBT) based environment to implement instruction set simulator (ISS)

This library contains the core elements of DBT-RISE and as such intended to be part of a target project like DPT-RISE-RISCV or RISCV-VP.

It implements the basic structure toquickly develop ISS using dynamic binary translation using LLVM as backend.
